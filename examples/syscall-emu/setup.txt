Strategy:
1. Use the analysis helpers to add ESIL expressions to 64-bit syscall instructions and make them interrupt with a custom code
2. Register a core plugin introducing a new command to handle syscalls
3. Register the new command as a macro to bypass cmd arg radare2 weirdness
4. Register the macro to execute when an ESIL interrupt expression is hit
